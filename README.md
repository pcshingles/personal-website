This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is the beginning of my personal website. It is very low fiedlity and I used it to learn React. I chose react because it's one of the most popular front-end JS+ libraries being used today, and for good reason: it's easy to use. There are probably a few anti-patterns within this project (not using React classes for boilerplate code in some cases), but I started this particular website with no knowledge of how to use React. I've gained some skills this summer on my internship that I've brought to this site, so it's a mixture of me applying better knowledge, and a spaghetti-sandbox. I have learned so much about web-dev from doing this, I can actually understand how CSS works now, thanks to the chrome dev-tools! (Don't look at the css it was not scaled properly in the slightest!) In the future my sites will never be this bad.

Here are the things I need to fix, for you to view publicly and shame me for: 
  - A fresh entrance to a certain path (i.e. /Resume) does not highlight the corresponding menu tab on load, only /Home.
  - The pictures in /Adventures only scale as the text grows, leaving out the cool photo. I need to add margins proportional to photo/text height.
  - The menu bar and header don't fit flush together, revealing some background.
  - I need to cache the google doc of my resume so that switching tabs doesn't cause a re-render.
  
Here are the things I want to add when I get free time (never):
  - Photos tab where I can make an album of my google photos from my favorite trips
  - github API to show projects and their links
  - Portfolio of some of my projects!
